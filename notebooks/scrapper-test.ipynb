For years, Bing had been a search engine also-ran. But it became a lot more interesting to industry insiders when it recently added new artificial intelligence technology.     Google’s reaction to the Samsung threat was “panic,” according to internal messages reviewed by The New York Times. An estimated $3 billion in annual revenue was at stake with the Samsung contract.

A.I. competitors like the new Bing are quickly becoming the most serious threat to Google’s search business in 25 years, and in response, Google is racing to build an all-new search engine powered by the technology. It is also upgrading the existing one with A.I. features, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.     The new features, under the project name Magi, are being created by designers, engineers and executives working in so-called sprint rooms to tweak and test the latest versions. The new search engine would offer users a far more personalized experience than the company’s current service, attempting to anticipate users’ needs.

JP Morgan has acquired troubled US bank First Republic in a rescue deal, which will see them take on all its $92 billion in deposits and buy most of its assets. In the US, a Texas father recounts how a gunman opened fire on his home and killed his wife and son. Meanwhile, celebrities are preparing for the Met Gala 2023 and rock band Aerosmith is announcing its farewell tour. Meanwhile, Disney is facing a countersuit in its feud with Florida. Additionally, the US government is lifting most federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and US and Philippines relations remain \"ironclad\" amidst tension with China. Goldman Sachs has recently concluded the dollar is up to 15% overvalued, and Elon Musk is attempting to direct AI yet again with his latest startup. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has authorized lawyers to sue Disney without providing details, and American journalists have long been navigating clampdowns in Russia, evident by the arrest of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich. Lastly, the private calendar of Jeffrey Epstein reveals prominent names, EY’s breakup plan is really dead, a kidney transplant drug may be able to keep you from aging, Boston is reconnecting with the art of the choke, California college students are in a desperate competition for spots in trailer parks, and West Virginia is facing storm clouds.
