For years, Bing had been a search engine also-ran. But it became a lot more interesting to industry insiders when it recently added new artificial intelligence technology.

A.I. competitors like the new Bing are quickly becoming the most serious threat to Google’s search business in 25 years, and in response, Google is racing to build an all-new search engine powered by the technology. It is also upgrading the existing one with A.I. features, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.     The new features, under the project name Magi, are being created by designers, engineers and executives working in so-called sprint rooms to tweak and test the latest versions.

      "Technology is playing an increasingly important role in our lives and the news is filled with stories reflecting that. Elon Musk is taking a unique approach to Tesla's price cuts in order to survive. Big tech earnings have been good and shares have risen, but growth has not been as impressive as Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Social-media shopping scams are targeting young adults and tech companies are beginning to ask for payment for content created by millions of people. Google has lost its bid to escape a digital-ad antitrust case, but ChatGPT has been allowed to resume operations in Italy after making data-privacy concessions. Stories about cloning with AI and protecting yourself if your iPhone is stolen have been shared. Executives who guide the Instacart CEO, doctors using AI to answer patient questions, and the top colleges for high-paying jobs in tech have been discussed. Europe has asked ChatGPT to disclose their sources, while subscription price creep and custom earplugs are also making news. Apple's new savings account could tempt users into overspending, tech billionaires are betting on fusion as the 'holy grail' for business, and startups are looking to remove 'forever chemicals'. There is a $300 million San Francisco office tower that is mostly empty and open to offers. States are attempting to limit access to online services, while conspiracy theories around the Denver airport are also gaining attention. SpaceX has shared a timeline of what went wrong on the most powerful rocket ever and social media platforms are connecting users with brands and influencers, prompting some to look for smaller networks. Wearable technology can be inaccurate but the broad trends can be helpful, and Musk has made changes to Twitter. Anita Harris is exploring the dangers of online dating, while J.D. Biersdorfer is sharing advice on how to use apps and tools for online collaboration. Finally, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has stopped providing service alerts on Twitter, Huawei reported an increase in revenue, the US visa agency has raised 'serious concerns', Portland General Electric has announced a major clean energy storage project, time-banking is a new way of getting paid, Belfast tech is using virtual reality to help victims prepare for court, the NHS Covid-19 app was shut down, AI Covid detection research is being adapted to help detect other illnesses, a man in the UK was sentenced for pointing an airgun at a drone, the UK games sector is backing a Microsoft deal to take over Activision, and Wikipedia has refused to comply with the UK's Online Safety Bill's age verification requirements.\n"
